README

You can create your own themes for the network_tray icon
You need to make a directory in /usr/share/network_tray 
naming it relevant to your theme.
Inside you put 5 24x24 pixel xpm icons named as follows:
	networkdead.xpm	
	networkblank.xpm
	networkin.xpm	
	networkout.xpm	
	networkboth.xpm
	
The script will detect your new theme and automatically put 
it in the window.

Have fun!
