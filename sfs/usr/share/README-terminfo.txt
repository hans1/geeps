This cutdown 'terminfo' folder is from Puppy 2.17, an earlier ncurses
package.

I tried the same cutdown selection -- or similar -- in ncurses v5.6 used
in RawPup but color was missing when ran 'mp' and 'dialog' in rxvt
terminal (but not when run before X started -- got color then). Probably
cold have fixed it, maybe just missing a file, but took easy way out.
