<title>PeasyPDF</title></head><body>PeasyPDF is a little program that builds multi-page PDF documents. Here are some ways to use it.<br>
<br>
1. You have a single photo or scanned document that you need to package
as a PDF file. Some organizations only accept email attachments in PDF
form.<br>
<br>
2. You want to package several graphic items into a single multi-page
PDF file. Your PDF reader program then acts as a simple slide-show
viewer.<br>
<br>
3. You want to add more items to an existing PDF file.<br>
<br>
4. You want to combine some individual PDF's into a single document.<br>
<br>
There is no entry in the Puppy menus for starting PeasyPDF - just a
link to the Help document. Instead, browse to the folder containing the
target files and run PeasyPDF from the command line. Type "peasypdf".
This is the fastest way to access your files.&nbsp; (To open a terminal
window in ROX, press the back-tick key above the Tab key.)<br>
<br>
Here are the steps to create a PeasyPDF document:<br>
<br>
Click "New". This starts a new project in the folder /tmp/PeasyPDF.<br>
<br>
Select a file and click "Add". You can:<br>
<br>
a. select it through the file chooser window.<br>
b. drag a file directly from a ROX window into PeasyPDF's file entry box.<br>
c. type in the name of a file.<br>
d. type in a list of names separated by spaces.<br>
e. use wild cards like *.jpg.<br>
f. use a combination of the above methods.<br>
<br>
If the filenames or their paths contain spaces, you must pick them
individually. For example, you would use this method to add files from
your Windows "Documents and Settings" folder. <br>
<br>
If the filenames do not contain spaces, you can optionally type a list
of names or use wild cards. For example, you could make a collection of
photos using "*.jpg" or even "Vacation/Day?/*.jpg". Just remember to
click the "No" button.<br>
<br>
You can even drag a group of files from a ROX window into the file entry box! But this only works if you have clicked "No".<br>
<br>
When all the files are added, click "Save". The project is saved in the
folder /tmp/PeasyPDF under the name "DOCUMENT.PDF". Copy it to a
permanent location and give it a descriptive name.<br>
<br>
The temporary folder also contains the original files in PDF form
numbered sequentially. They will remain until you click "New". So if
you want to add another file to the project, just use "Add" and "Save"
again. Or move to a different source folder and add more files from
there.<br>
<br>
If you have some small images, you can glue them together onto one page
of your project. Click "Glue" and drag two files into the input boxes.
The resulting PDF file is automatically added to the project folder.<br>
<br>
You will also see the file GLUED.JPG in the project folder. You can
reuse it to glue three or more images together. You will then need to
manually delete the previous glued pages from the project.<br>
<br>
Note: Many applications have a "Print to File" option that lets you
save your work in PDF format. For example, you can capture web pages
from your browser and add them to a PDF document. However, you may have
better luck saving them in PostScript (PS) format instead of PDF.
PostScript files sometimes work better in PeasyPDF.<br>
