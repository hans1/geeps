<h1>yaf-splash (new)</h1>
The "old" yaf-splash is available as a PET package, and most likely
already in your Puppy. It is located at /usr/X11R7/bin/yaf-splash. The
documentation for the old yaf-splash is at
/usr/share/doc/yaf-splash.htm.<br>
<br>
There is an enhanced replacement for yaf-splash, a script located at
/usr/bin/gtkdialog-splash, with /usr/bin/yaf-splash symlinked to it.<br>
<br>
If you simply execute 'yaf-splash', the new one will run. However, the
gtkdialog-splash script will launch the old one (if installed) if it
detects the "-font" parameter in the commandline.<br>
<br>
The new yaf-splash does not use the '-font' parameter (ignores it). Here are the commandline options of the new yaf-splash:<br>
<br>
<pre>&nbsp;-text EXPRESSION<br>&nbsp;-timeout COUNT (in seconds)<br>&nbsp;-icon GTK-XXX (for example: gtk-info all gtk-stock-symbols, default: none)<br>&nbsp;-bg COLOR (background color red, blue, yellow..., default: grey)<br>&nbsp;-fg COLOR (font color, default: black)<br>&nbsp;-placement center|mouse|top|bottom|top-left|bottom-left (default center)<br>&nbsp;-close never|mouseover|box (default is mouseover)<br>&nbsp;-deco TITLE (shows windows decorations, with title)<br>&nbsp;-fontsize SIZE (small, medium, large, x-large, default: large)</pre>
<br>
Example:<br>
<br>
<pre># yaf-splash -placement top -close box -text "This is a message"</pre>
<br>
The new yaf-splash was originally written by 'mave', modified by BarryK.<br>
<br>
Note that the new yaf-splash works best with the JWM window manager,
which is setup to treat the 'gtkdialog-splash' class in a special way
(see /root/.jwmrc).<br>
Those who prefer the old yaf-splash may continue to use it, simply by
putting in the '-font' parameter -- which is always done anyway.<br>
