<h2 id="about">1.What is Grub4Dos?</h2>
<p>Grub is well known as a bootup loader for Linux and other operating systems.
Puppy Linux is ever using Grub as the bootup loader as well as Syslinux(for floppy disks and for USB flash memories). 
But there is a difficulty for beginners to apply.
Grub requires ext2/ext3 file system, which is special for Linux.
Grub4Dos has compatibility with Grub and has a remarkable feature. It can be installed on NTFS/FAT filesystems which are more common on Windows preinstalled PC's.
</p>
<p>Grub4Dos supports vfat, ntfs, ext2, ext3, ext4, reiserfs(grub4dosconfig-version 1.7 and later), but the reiserfs support has some limitation.</p>
<p>(Add for v1.6)<br>
Supporting ext4 file system was partially as for the grub4dosconfig-0.4.4.v1.5.x.
It required the help of grub legacy as for the etx4.
grub4dosconfig-0.4.4.v1.6 has now ext4 full support thanks to the '<a href="http://nufans.net/grub4dos/wee/">Wee</a>' for the MBR.

<h2 id="install">2.Installing Grub4Dos</h2>
<div align="right"><a href="../ja/grub4dosconfig.html#install">Japanese</a></div>
<h3 id="whatis">What are installed?</h3>
<p>Grub4Dos installs 3 components. One is the Boot Record and other 2 is normal files, 'grldr' and 'menu.lst'.
The 'grldr' and 'menu.lst' is usually installed on the 1st partition of the target HDD.
</p>
<h3 id="whereto">Where to install?</h3>
<p>'Boot Record' is the space on a hard disk drive(HDD) special for storing bootup code.
'MBR(Master Boot Record)' is the one at the top of a drive, and normally boots off from the one of the 1st HDD, usually 'sda' or 'hda'.
To install on MBR(of the 1st HDD) is the common case. But you can install Grub4Dos on another drive.
Note that the order of the HDD can be differ between that Puppy recognizes and that BIOS/Grub4Dos recognizes at bootup stage.
This issue will be discussed on another section of this document.
</p>
<p>Maybe it is more safe way if you install Grub4Dos on a USB flash memory drive rather than internal HDD.
Note that this way is usable only in case your PC has the ability of booting up from USB drive and you know the BIOS settings to enable it. 
</p>
<p>If your PC has a floppy disk drive and is able to bootup from it,
make a bootup floppy which is Grub4Dos installed.
New disk is preferable.
You can also use a used disk, but the data on the disk will be all erased.
Before you use the floppy disk, make sure there are no important files on it.
</p>
<h3 id="noneed">Not to install Boot Record?</h3>
<p>The existing MBR may have (the code kicking) 'ntldr' which starts up Windows.
If so and you like to use this existing MBR, tick &quot;<b>Do not rewrite existing Boot Record</b>&quot;.
In this case, only 'grldr' and 'menu.lst' will be installed.
You may need configure to chain 'grldr' from MBR.
For example, if you use 'ntldr', add the entry which chain to 'grldr' in 'boot.ini'.
See <a href="http://diddy.boot-land.net/grub4dos/files/install.htm">Grub4dos Guide - Loading/Installing Grub4dos</a>.</p>
<p>
In other case the boot record was over written by other than Grub4Dos, you may like to recover Grub4Dos using old 'menu.lst'.
Tick &quot;<b>Do not rewrite 'menu.lst'</b>&quot; in this case.
</p>
<p>The Boot Record is always installed in case a floppy disk is the target.</p>
<h3 id="pbsinstall">Install to the Partition Boot Sector</h3>
<p>The grub4dosconfig-version 1.7 and later can install the bootloader on the Partition Boot Sector(PBS).
It works when the partition boot flag is set so that the MBR can load the PBS and excute it.
Or you can use the PBS boot co-operating with some bootloader manager.
Use the PBS boot only if you know what it is and you can manage it.
</p>
<p>
The grub4dosconfig does not show partitions but only the drives on the list at the begining.
Click 'Show PBS' button if you want to install the bootloader on the PBS.
</p>
<p>Installing on the PBS of ext4 partitions requires extlinux-v4.x and chain.c32.
If the version of the extlinux is less than 4.0 or lacking the 'chain.c32', you need to install them.
To know the version of your system, type 'extlinux --version' on the terminal.
</p>
<p>The grub4dosconfig does not support installing on the PBS on reiserfs partitions.</P>
<h3 id="bootflag">Boot flag, when and where does it need?</h3>
<p>
The boot flag on a partition is basically to tell which partition is to be chained from the master boot record. 
The Grub4Dos as the master boot record, it need not the boot flag because it knows what to do next by the 'menu.lst' file.
</p>
<p>But some BIOS does not boot up from the drive which has no boot flag.
In such case, you need the boot flag. It can be any partition on the drive you want to boot up from.
The boot flag is allowed at only one partition for a drive, but do not worry. You can boot up from any partition via Grub4Dos regardless the boot flag.
</p>
<p>It is better to set the boot flag on removable media such as USB flash/HDD drives.
Even though it can boot up without the flag with your PC, it may fail with another PC.
</p>
<p>The boot flag can be managed by the GParted or some other tools.</p>
<h2 id="bootmenu">3.Bootup menu</h2>
<div align="right"><a href="../ja/grub4dosconfig.html#bootmenu">Japanese</a></div>
<h3 id="editmenu">Editing menu</h3>
<p>Grub4DosConfig searches in the internal HDD and connected external HDD and lists up installed Puppy's and other Linux operating systems.</p>
<p>You can rewrite the string in the boxes which will be showed in the menu at bootup.
Erase it (fill with blank) if you like to remove the item from the bootup menu.
But caution! These 2 (rewrite or erase) is only you can do for this dialog.
You cannot add new item nor arrange the order here.
You can manually edit the 'menu.lst' after install finished.
</p>
<p><b>Options</b>(Add for v1.6)<br>
You can add boot options for 'frugal' installed Puppy and for full installed Puppy/Linux.
See the '<a href="#options">Adding bootup options</a>' section of this document.
Keep the entry as is if you are unsure. 
</p>
<h3 id="windows">Windows menu</h3>
<p>At least one items of Windows menu are displayed here no matter they are installed or not.
Erase the items if you do not need boot up Windows.
But the top entry is recommended to leave.
Especially in case you install Grub4Dos on removable devices,
because they might be useful with other PC's.
</p>
<p>Here again you cannot change the order.
For example, if you like to bootup Windows XP only,
replace the column 'Windows Vista/2008/7' with blank, rewrite 'Windows NT/2000/2003/XP' as 'Windows XP' and blank instead of 'Windows 9x/Me'. 
</p>
<h3 id="bootable">Bootable partitions</h3>
<p>(v1.6.3 and later)<br />
Grub4DosConfig detects partitions with the boot flag on.
It does not always mean you can boot up from the partiton.
There may be cases boot flag is on but the boot loader is not there.
These entries on the 'Bootable partitions' section must be redundant because the OS is already listed up on the leading sections.
You can erase these entries, but leave it for the first try.
See which entries can successfully boot up the OS, and remove it from the menu after you are sure you can boot up the OS with another entry.</p>
<h3 id="duplicate">Duplicated folder names</h3>
<p>If you make folders of same name, even they are on different disk drives or partitions,
it must confuse the loader and fails the bootup as the result.
Change names of the folders if the error noted.
Then restart Grub4DosConfig.</p>
<p>(Add for v1.6)<br />
v1.6 and later can manage this case. It is not recommended but you can continue. Press 'OK'.</p>
<h2 id="editmenulst">4.Editing 'menu.lst'</h2>
<div align="right"><a href="../ja/grub4dosconfig.html#editmenulst">Japanese</a></div>
<p>Refer to <a href="http://diddy.boot-land.net/grub4dos/files/menu.htm">Grub4dos Guide - Configuration File Entries</a> for the detail of writing 'menu.lst'.</p>
<h3 id="incase">What case we need editing?</h3>
<p>Grub4DosConfig produce 'menu.lst' automatically.
But you might need editing 'menu.lst' in case Puppy is full installed.
In case Puppy is frugal installed and other operating systems are only Windows,
probably you can use the automatically produced 'menu.lst' with no problem.</p>
<h3 id="full">Full installed systems</h3>
<p>There is a trap in booting up full installed Puppy and/or other Linux OS.
You need to specify the partition of the Linux kernel('vmlinuz') and the position of the root file system.
The previous is direction to the Grub4Dos at the bootup process and the latter is direction to the Linux kernel.
</p>
<p>The trap is:<br>
Drives which Grub4Dos recognizes and the drives the Linux kernel recognizes are not always the same.
Moreover, those current running Puppy recognizes might differ from them.
</p>
<p>
In most case, the first HDD is called '(hd0)' by Grub4Dos and 'sda' by (Puppy)Linux.
The first partition is called '(hd0,0)'  by Grub4Dos and 'sda1' by (Puppy)Linux.  
But 'sda' can be '<b>h</b>da'. And the others may be more complex.</p>
<p>You may need to rewrite '(hd0,0)' to '(hd<b>1</b>,0)', or '/dev/sda1' to '/dev/<b>h</b>da1' on the 'menu.lst'</p>
<p>(Add for v1.6)<br>
The grub4dosconfig-0.4.4.v1.6 and later uses the partition UUID instead of '(hd<i>n</i>,0)', where the number <b><i>n</i></b> depends on the drive order.
The UUID is a unique code for the partition itself, independent from the drive arrangement.
You need to care only the issue of '/dev/sda1' or something.
</p>
<h3 id="oldmenulst">Looking up existing 'menu.lst'</h3>
<p>The old 'menu.list' must be exist if Grub4Dos or Grub was installed.
They may be at top('/'), '/boot' or '/boot/grub' directory.
They can be renamed such as like 'menu-2009-08-12-144950.lst'.
If exists, you can copy entries from the old 'menu.list'.
</p>
<h3 id="options">Adding bootup options(parameters)(both Frugal/Full install)</h3>
<p>
Produced 'menu.lst' has normal boot options.
You can add another options like 'acpi=off'.
</p>
<p>Grub4DosConfig adds 'pmedia=usbflash' or 'pmedia=usbhd' option in case the drive is connected to USB interface.
Rewrite them if they are wrong.
Grub4DosConfig does not detect SSD(Flash Solid State Drive).
You are better to take the boot option 'pmedia=ataflash' or 'pmedia=usbflash' for USB devices rather than 'pmedia=atahd' if your drive is SSD.
</p>
<p>Refer to <a href="http://pupweb.org/wikka/BootParms">BootParms</a>.</P>
<h3 id="classic">Classic Puppy</h3>
<p>Classic Puppy's (1.x-3.x) have special boot parameter than Puppy-4.x/5.x.
You need to manually edit the boot parameters.
As for the Classic Pup-2.x, visit <a href="http://www.murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=42553">the topic on Forum</a>.
</p>
<h3 id="order">Listing order</h3>
<p>
You can change the order of the menu items.
Cut the lines from the 'title'-line to the line before the next 'title'-line,
and paste them to proper position.
The default item is defined at the 'default'-line.
the top item is numbered as '0', next is '1' and so on.
</p>
<h3 id="legacy">Grub4Dos specific commands</h3>
<p>If you are used to the Grub legacy, you find strange entries in the 'menu.lst' the Grub4DosConfig' made.
Don't worry. Grub4Dos is upper compatible with the Grub legacy.
So, you can use the command of the Grub legacy you used to.
For exsample, 'find-set-root' and 'uui xxxx-xxxx-xxxx' are the Grub4Dos specific commands to locate the partition.
You can use classic 'root (hd0,1)' or something insted of 'find-set-root' or 'uui xxxx-xxxx-xxxx'. 
<br />
For example, next 2 works almost equally.
</p>
<pre># for Grub4Dos only
title Windows Vista/2008/7 (sda2:PBS)
  uuid 6C54F6966CE8F58D
  chainloader +1</pre>
<pre># both Grub4dos and Grub legacy work
title Windows Vista/2008/7 (sda2:PBS)
  root (hd0,1)
  chainloader +1</pre>
<h2 id="newmenu">5. Newly introduced menu items</h2>
<h3 id="chain">Chainload PBS</h3>
<p>(v1.6.3 and later)<br />
Grub4DosConfig gives menu items chainload the Partition Boot Records, like '(sda2:PBS)'. 
It does not always mean you can boot up from the partiton. 
there may be cases boot flag is on but the boot loader is not there.
These items may be redundant because the OS is already listed up on the leading items. 
</p>
<h3 id="find">Find Grub menu on HDD</h3>
<p>
When you install the Grub4Dos on removable media, the Grub4DosConfig adds 'Find Grub menu on HDD' entry at the boot menu.
You can bootup from the Grub4Dos installed media and switch the boot menu to the one on the HDD.
It can be a rescue if you installed grub(legacy) or Grub4Dos on the HDD but the MBR or somthing corrupted.
</p>
<h3 id="grub2">Find Grub2</h3>
<p>(Add for v1.6)<br>
Some of recent Linux uses 'Grub2' instead of legacy grub.
The Grub4Dos and Grub2 can coexist.
If your Linux installed Grub2, and you are not contented with bootup directly from the Grub4Dos,
you can chain load the Grub2 from the Grub4Dos by selecting 'Find Grub2' at the boot menu.
</p>
<p>That's all. Take care!<br/>Sep 2009 <i>Shinobar</i><br>
Nov 2010: Add for v1.6<br>
