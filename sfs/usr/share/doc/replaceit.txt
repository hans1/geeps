ReplaceIt : Simple but effective text file string replacement tool

Inspiration:
	I needed a tool to make my life easier when it came to 
writing install scripts for various different OS's and Distributions
of OS's.  One of the biggest troubles is making alterations to 
existing text configuration files.

	I was too lazy to work out how to mix grep, sed, awk head
tail and any other "normal" unix type tools to combine to attain
the required effect.  I also wanted it to be a BSD-type licence
as I believe in it.

	So, in a couple of hours (it took longer to write these
documents than replaceit!!) I created ReplaceIt.

Enjoy.

Licence:
	BSD-type

Limitations:
	Currently (version 1.0.0) only replaces one instance per
line.

Usage:
	(see the output from running ./replaceit for more details)

	ReplaceIt has three compulsorary parameters, along followed
by zero or more optional "rule-tokens". Each rule token consists of
an optional modifier character [+,-,{,}] and a string.  

The meaning of the optional modifier character is as follows:

	+ : Ignore this char and consider the rest of the string
		literally. (we use this if we want to have a '-'
		in our string as the first char, ie, "+-option"

	- : The string following must NOT be present on the line

	} : The string following must appear AFTER the string to be
		replaced.

	{ : The string following must appear BEFORE the string to be
		replaced.

Examples:


	./replaceit --input=myfile "replace" "with-this"

Will replace the first occurance of "replace" with "with-this" 
(no quotes) in every line of the file "myfile".


	./replaceit --input=myfile "replace" "with-this" "has this"

Will replace "replace" with "with-this" only if the line also has
the string "has this" in it.


	./replaceit --input=file "rep" "with" "has this" "-not this"

Will replace "rep" with "with" if the line has "has this" but NOT "not this" in it.


	./replaceit --input=file "rep" "with" "+-something" "{extra"

Will replace "rep" with "with" if the line has the string 
"-something" in it, and the string "extra" appears BEFORE the string
"rep".
