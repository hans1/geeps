This is a mod of the Gpptp application originally by Andrew Kozin 2006 <stanson@btv.ru> 

1) In the /etc/ppp directory, copy the ip-up-EXAMPLE file to ip-up
2) edit the options.pptp file in /etc/ppp and uncomment the  "#require-mppe-128" line.

I changed gpptp to look in two text files named "vpn_servers" and "vpn_userids" for vpn servers 
and usernames to populate the dropdown lists in the app, and added a "Close" button. These two 
files are user editable and need one entry per line. They need to be placed in the /etc/ppp folder. 
They contain examples that can be removed. I also changed it to find the "real" process ID (pid) 
of the pppd process (before it was chasing the pid of the pptp process)and allow you to disconnect 
and reconnect as needed. The Gpptp executable should be placed in /usr/sbin. It would be wise to 
rename the original first instead of overwriting it in case you want to switch back.

One of the problems with the "stock" gpptp is that after you disconnect the VPN connection
the dns didn't revert to what it was before you ran it. If you disconnect the newer version
via the gui, it will reset your DNS servers.

So you can connect to a VPN server, close the app, check you email or whatever, run the app
again and it will show you are still connected and show you a button to disconnect.

I've left out the wrapper script that sets routes through the VPN connection because the lucid versions do this
automatically, which is the expected behavior.

Good luck,
