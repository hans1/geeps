FFConvert is a frontend of FFmpeg, the multimedia converter.

ABOUT PRESET

  FFConvert seach the preset files from
  1) $HOME/.config/ffconvert/preset directory
  2) /usr/share/ffconvert/preset.d directory
  3) /usr/share/ffconvert/preset file
  
  In the 1) and 2) directory, each preset is saved as a file with the name of the preset
  and contains ffmpeg options in 1 line.
  For example, /usr/share/ffconvert/preset.d/MS_Compatible_AVI_mspmeg4v2(the preset name is 'MS Compatible AVI mspmeg4v2'):
  -f avi -vcodec msmpeg4v2  -b 1000k     -acodec libmp3lame -ab 192k -ar 44100 
  
  In the 3) file has multiple presets line by line. Each line has the name of the preset,
  then comma(','), and follows the ffmpeg options. They are thanks to Technosaurus.
  For example, a line for 'NTSC DVD Fullscreen':
  NTSC DVD Fullscreen, -f dvd -vcodec mpeg2video -r 29.97 -s 352x480 -aspect 4:3 -b 4000kb -mbd rd -trellis -mv0 -cmp 2 -subcmp 2 -acodec mp2 -ab 192kb -ar 48000 -ac 2

  The files 1) can be manipurated by the GUI of FFConvert. All 1)-3) files are plain texts,
  so you can edit them manually using text editors. 
  
ABOUT NLS

  FFConvert is i18n'ed thanks to the gettext system. The catalogue is used by ffconvert and ffplay.sh.
  The .pot file is at /usr/share/doc/nls/ffconvert, or you can make new one with next command(DEVX sfs required): 
  xgettext --lang=shell -o ffconvert.pot /usr/bin/ffconvert
  
  Use proper editors like Poedit to make the translations. Place the .mo file with name 'ffconvert.mo'
  at /usr/share/locale/*/LC_MESSAGES, where '*' is the language code.

  FFConvert help file is at /usr/share/doc/ffconvert/ffconvert.html and ffconvert_inside.txt(this file).
  You can put the translated help file at /usr/share/doc/help/*/ffconvert/ffconvert.html and ffconvert_inside.txt with images, where '*' is the language code.
