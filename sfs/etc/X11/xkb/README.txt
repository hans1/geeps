This xkb folder is very cutdown.

In Puppy 1.0.8r1, xkb is somewhat broken.
Pakt, lior2b and Dougal have investigated and devised improved
xkb folders.

Puppy2 alpha snapshot of 21 March 2006 has the same xkb folder
as 1.0.8r1.

For Puppy2 alpha snapshot of 29 March, I am experimenting with
Dougal's xkb folder -- let us know on the forum how it works.

April 7, 2006:
Pakt has found some problems with dougal's xkb and has devised
another, very small. This is now in Puppy2.

Dec. 13, 2006:
Dougal has totally reworked this directory. Previously it was
taken out of Slackware 10.1, but Puppy 2.10+ has upgraded to
Xorg 7.0. Dougal has now also upgraded this kbd directory with
files from Xorg 7.0 as compiled in T2.

2006-2011
xkb dir compatible with xorg 7.4/7.5.

June 2011
added rules/evdev, rules/evdev.lst, needed by Mageia 1.
