# This is an example smb.conf for a simple Samba-TNG setup.
# Please read SETUP-with-ldap.txt before!
# You can either find this in the distribution in docs/textdocs/
# or in the doc-directory for samba-tng in your distribution.
#

[global]

# If you want to automatically load your printer list rather
# than setting them up individually then you'll need this
	load printers = yes

# DNS Proxy - tells Samba whether or not to try to resolve NetBIOS names
# via DNS nslookups.
	dns proxy = no

# Put a capping on the size of the log files (in Kb).
	max log size = 50

# Security mode. Most people will want user level security. See
# security_level.txt for details.
	security = user

#  Domain and Server
# -------------------
#
# The value of the attribute workgroup describes the domain or
# workgroup name. You MUST NOT set up two domain controllers (PDC)
# in one single network environment with the same workgroup-/ domain
# name!!!
	workgroup		= tng-workgroup
	server string		= Samba-TNG Server

# Your server should not have a netbios name which is already present
# in the network. The default is to use the (Linux-) hostname of the
# server. If you want to change that, use the 'netbios name' option: 

; netbios name = tng-srv

# If your TNG server should act as a primary domain controller
# (PDC) set:
;	domain master		= yes
;	domain logons		= yes
# Beware! You MUST NOT have any other PDC in the same
# domain!
	domain master		= no
	domain logons		= no

# If you want TNG to act as PDC you need at least one
# wins server. Set:
;	wins support		= yes
# ...so TNG will become a wins server - the default value is 'no'
# If you already have a running wins server, use:
;	wins server 		= xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

#  LDAP
# ------
#
# TNG can use one of two different back-ends for user
# data: smbpasswd or LDAP. The LDAP backend is the most
# flexible and elaborated - it's strongly recommended
# to use this one!
# Note: if you want to use LDAP with ssl, change
# LDAP uri into ldaps://...
# An example for basic LDAP settings in smb.conf looks
# like this:

;	ldap uri		= ldap://127.0.0.1
;	ldap suffix 		= dc=tng,dc=org
;	ldap bind as	 	= cn=root,dc=tng,dc=org
;	ldap passwd file	= /etc/samba-tng/ldapsecret

# Warning: Setting 'ldap delete dn' to 'yes' will delete a complete
# user from the directory service - not only the samba-tng related
# attributes! Anyway, user files will not be deleted.

;	ldap delete dn		= yes

#  Profile and User
# ------------------
#
# Attention:
# The following four options ('logon home',
# 'logon drive', 'logon path' and 'logon script')  may be overridden
# by the user's LDAP attributes.

# The home-directory of the user is default: 

; logon home = \\%N\%U

# On the workstation side the logon drive will be mounted and assigned
# with a letter. This letter has to be an unused one - check your
# workstations for a free one to avoid collisions!  

; logon drive = h:

# If you want to use roaming profiles, set the default here - if you
# do not want to use it, leave the following commented out.

;	logon path		= \\%N\profiles\%U

# You may want to use a logon script (set time, connect other shares).
# Notice: This path is relative to the netlogon share!

;	logon script		= start.bat


#  Others 
# -------- 
# If things do not work right, increase the log level to get more
# debugging information. Log level 2 is a "good choice".

;	log level		= 2

# for security reasons set write access default to no:
;	writable			= no

;[netlogon]
;	comment			= "Logonscripts and other profile data"
;	path			= /etc/samba-tng/netlogon

[homes]
	comment			= "Home directory for %U"
	writable		= yes

# For roaming profiles you need a special share. This example
# needs a a+wt directory (chmod 1777 /home/nt-profiles):
;[profiles]
;	path 			= /home/nt-profiles
;	writable 		= yes
;	create mask		= 700
;	directory mask		= 700

[printers]
   comment = All Printers
   browseable = no
   # Set public = yes to allow user 'guest account' to print
   guest ok = no
   writable = no
   printable = yes
