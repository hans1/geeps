<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>atmel_fwl</B>

loads firmware images for Atmel at76c50x series wireless networking
chips into the Linux driver for same.
<P>
Note that this utility is not normally necessary, since the driver will
automatically load the correct firmware image via the hotplug
system. Atmel_fwl is provided for applications where use of the
hotplug system may not be desirable. 
<P>
atmel_fwl should be run after the interface has been created (after
card insertion, in the case of PCMCIA cards) but before it is brought
up by running ifconfig.

<H2>NOTES</H2>

Note that there are two versions of many of the firmware images, the
second one with the suffix &quot;-wpa&quot;. These are later releases from Atmel
which support WPA privacy. They are only usable by versions of the
driver greater than 0.9. Be sure not to use the &quot;-wpa&quot; one unless your in-kernel
driver code is version 0.9 or better. Sadly, as of version 0.9, the
in-kernel driver does not actually support the setting of WPA
passphrases.
<P>
The firmware images are usually installed in /usr/lib/hotplug/firmware.
<P>
The status of the driver, including its firmware loading, is available
in /proc/driver/atmel
